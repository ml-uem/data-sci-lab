MACHINE LEARNING UEM PACKAGE
It is a machine learning model to verify the error. 
​
GETTING STARTED:
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
​
Prerequisits:
First thing you need it is to install python 3 or high on your pc because this model runs whit it. 
Second you must download package from github 'https://github.com/ml-uem/data-sci-lab'.
​
Installing:
1.	Install extensions: 'Python' and 'Git' on your 'VSC' or other coding program  
2.	Use command 'pip install' for example 'pip install mypackages', 'pip install numpy'...
​
RUNNING TEST
1.	You have to run file call '__init__.py' which has all classes for regressions  
2.  Choose regression you want to study your dataset and verify your error
3.	In folder 'samples' you can load the data to view
